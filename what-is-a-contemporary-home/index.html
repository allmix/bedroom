<h3 id="contemporary-design-and-modern-design-are-two-distinct-stylistic-movements">Contemporary Design And Modern Design Are Two Distinct Stylistic Movements.</h3><p>Unlike modern architecture, contemporary architecture is not rooted in any one time period. As weâve said before, contemporary homes utilize a lot of open spaces and natural materials. Railroad ties, street signs, shower doors, and even phone books.

Contemporary homes often create contrast by using a combination of different building materials for the facade. That is, contemporary homes reflect architectural trends of the moment â whatâs contemporary now may not be contemporary 20 years from now. Instead, both designs are pared down to include only the most basic and essential elements.</p>
