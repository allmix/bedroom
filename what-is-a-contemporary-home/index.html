<h3 id="contemporary-design-and-modern-design-are-two-distinct-stylistic-movements">Contemporary Design And Modern Design Are Two Distinct Stylistic Movements.</h3><p>Unlike modern architecture, contemporary architecture is not rooted in any one time period. As we’ve said before, contemporary homes utilize a lot of open spaces and natural materials. Railroad ties, street signs, shower doors, and even phone books. In contemporary homes, shapes and textures take the spotlight.</p>

<h3 id="homes-may-be-made-out-of">Homes May Be Made Out Of.</h3><p>The style tends to include large plate glass windows, metal or concrete. Contemporary homes often create contrast by using a combination of different building materials for the facade. That is, contemporary homes reflect architectural trends of the moment — what’s contemporary now may not be contemporary 20 years from now. Instead, both designs are pared down to include only the most basic and essential elements.</p>
